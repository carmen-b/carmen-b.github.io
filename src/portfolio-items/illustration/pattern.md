The first pattern is inspired from the plants world using a fresh military green tint as background. The second pattern - Fox and Terrier is based on a minimalist and elegant design, creating a balance between red and blue. The third pattern - Delaunay is an abstract geometric pattern inspired by the mathematical process of surface triangulation. 

Created with Adobe Illustrator.
