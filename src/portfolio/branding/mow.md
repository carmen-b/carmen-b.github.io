I designed a brand identity proposal for the Memory of the World Programme. It consisted of logo, business cards, and letterheads. The invitations and panels were used for the exhibition “Memory of the World”  held at Chiostro di Santa Croce in Florence. 

Created with Adobe Illustrator and InDesign.
