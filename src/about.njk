        <p>I’m Carmen Balaban, a freelance graphic designer based in Baia Mare, Romania. I specialize in logo design, stationery, advertising, web design, and digital illustration.</p>
        <p>As a freelancer, I’ve developed a wide range of work: advertising posters, brochures, catalogs, and product collections for school supplies. I’ve also participated in design competitions, exhibitions, arts and crafts fairs, and festival projects focused on visual arts.</p>
        <p>Outside project work, I enjoy crossword puzzles, origami, and practicing Copperplate calligraphy. I’m always open to new challenges and collaborations.</p>
