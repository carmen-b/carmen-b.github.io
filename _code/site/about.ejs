            <p>I’m Carmen Balaban - a freelance graphic designer based in Baia Mare, Romania. I specialize in logo design, stationery, advertising, web design and digital illustration.
</p>
            <p>As a freelancer I’ve been able to create a wide range of products: from advertising posters, brochures, catalogs to designing several collections for school supplies. Besides this I’ve been involved in related activities such as: design competitions, personal exhibitions, participating at international arts and craft fairs, and organizing festivals about visual arts. </p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy solving crossword puzzles, making origami and lately I’ve been practicing Copperplate calligraphy. Also I like to learn things and experience new challenges. Please feel free to get in touch via email or by using the form in the contact page.
